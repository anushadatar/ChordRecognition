# Chord Recognition: The Fourier Transform and Automated Classification
Olin College Linearity I SP18 Final Project, Alison Palmer and Anusha Datar.

This project was mainly an exploration into the mathematics and physical concepts associated with Fourier analysis and its application to note and chord recognition. Along with a [paper](https://github.com/anushadatar/ChordRecognition/blob/master/docs/LIN_PROJECT.pdf), we wrote and documented executable note and chord recognition [programs](https://github.com/anushadatar/ChordRecognition/tree/master/code) that print the identity of a tone contained in a .wav file passed to the program. Models trained based on kaggle datasets cited in the [/data](https://github.com/anushadatar/ChordRecognition/tree/master/data) directory.
